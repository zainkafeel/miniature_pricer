Minature Pricing Server

This is a sample project for Regentmarket Markets Group company recruitement process.

For purpose of the test, assume a system that accepts following parameters and generate a price as decribed bellow. 

F = S * e ^ (r*t)

F : Future Contract
S : Current spot price, you will receive it from a third party provider in a realtime manner.
t: time in year for finding future price.
r : Annualized Interest rate. It is defined based on the following table

Day  | Rate
-----------
1    | 10%
30   | 5%
60   | 4%
90   | 2%
210  | 2

To find interest rates that are not in the table use interpolation.

For example:

Future contract if current price is 10 in thirty days is 

F = 10 * e ^ (5/100 * 30/365)


goal
================
Build a pricing server that can accept the required parameters and generate price.
The format to get data or to providing output is up to you.
